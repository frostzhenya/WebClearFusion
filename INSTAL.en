	Create a database with any of his name (I ordered it to wcf).
	Next, adjust the conf.php:
	 $config_db_connect ['whostname'] = '127 .0.0.1 '; - host, that is, u e.
	 $config_db_connect ['wusername'] =''; name for the connection to the database.
	 $config_db_connect ['wpassword'] =''; connection password to the database.
	 $config_db_connect ['wdbname'] = 'wcf'; the base itself, in this case wcf.
	Next, we need to create a connection to the database of characters, realms, and the world.
	We climb into www\module\include\realmlist.php and set up (I will not explain the setting, since it is similar to conf.php).
	If you have any questions ask here or write to Soap (<lovepsone@mail.ru>).
